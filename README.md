# Reinforcement Learning for Scheduling of Maintenance
I started by learning the basics of reinforcement learning and understood all the terminologies like policy, value functions etc. Then went on to markov decision process and markov reward process where we completely know the dynamics of the environment that are the transition probablities from one state to other, rewards on taking certain action etc. MDP are basic framework or the foundation of any agent environment interface but there can be environment where we are unaware or partially aware the dynamics. Then I studied Dynamic Programming which was used to evaluate the policy and even improve the policy using greedy algorithm. I studied two methods to solve the model free prediction that is when the environment is not known to us, Montecarlo method and Temporal difference learning. When I was done with the theory I started to code to train different environments. In this repository I have tried to make my on environment based on Maintenance Scheduling and solved it using Q-learning and Epsilon greedy algorithm to solve it. This environement is built based on a research paper which contains four level of complexity of model and each has been taken care separately. I have added the research paper which I have used as resource in the repo and also added the results obtained after training the data for different levels.
